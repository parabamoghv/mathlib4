# Formalized Euclidean Geometry

This branch is dedicated to the formalization of **Euclidean geometry** and various **proofs of the Pythagorean theorem** in Lean.  
The project is a **work in progress**.

## Structure

- **`Pythagoras/Geometry.lean`** — contains formalizations of fundamental geometric objects: 
  - Lines  
  - Circles  
  - Triangles  
  - Quadrilaterals  
  - and other basic constructions.

- **`Pythagoras/GarfieldSimple.lean`** — provides a simple formalization of the **Pythagorean theorem** based on [Garfield’s proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield%27s_proof_of_the_Pythagorean_theorem).

### Status
🚧 *Work in progress — additional proofs and formalizations to be added soon.*

---

### Acknowledgment
Inspired by the classical foundations of Euclidean geometry and the goal of bringing them into a formal proof environment.
